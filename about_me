I learned C++ in 1999/2000. I had some bad people prevent me from working as a programmer because I was born a girl. I'm old and ugly and it should be time for me to enjoy working in the only career and activity I actually liked. People knew my brother and though I was just likehim, but I was oppiste. I lost everything over that connection on Facebook with him.
